**🛡️ Phishing Email Analyzer (Web Application)**


📌 Project Overview

Phishing attacks are one of the most common cybersecurity threats, targeting users through deceptive emails that appear legitimate. These emails often attempt to steal sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or banking details.

The Phishing Email Analyzer is a web-based cybersecurity application that analyzes email content and determines whether an email is Legitimate, Suspicious, or Phishing using rule-based detection techniques.

The system provides not only the classification but also a risk score and detailed reasons, helping users understand why an email is unsafe.
